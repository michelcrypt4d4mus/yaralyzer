# If you place a filed called '.yaralyzer' in your home dir or the current dir environment variables specified
# in that .yaralyzer file will be added to the environment each time yaralyzer is invoked. (See the `dotenv`
# package for more details.) This file contains environment variables you can place in .yaralyzer to configure
# the application above and beyond providing command line options.  Useful if you want to permanently
# configure options you tend to reuse (e.g. '--maximize-width') so you can stop remembering to type them.
# Easiest way to do this is probably to just copy this file to one in your home or working directory and customize.

# Longer byte sequences are for obvious reasons slower to decode by force.
# It may feel counterintuitive but larger chunks of random binary are also harder to examine and
# (in my experience) less likely to be maningful. Consider it - two frontslash characters 20,000 lines apart
# are more likely to be random than those same frontslashes when placed nearer to each other and
# in the vicinity of lot of computerized sigils of internet power like `.', `+bacd*?`,. and other regexes.*

# Directory to write application logs to. Must be an absolute path, not a relative one.
# These logs are not normally written to a file and the default log level means that the standard behavior
# is to more or less discard them. Be aware that if you configure this variable a few things will change:
#
#   1. Logs WILL NOT be written to STDOUT. They will stream ONLY to files in the configured directory.
#      This is true even with the -D option.
#   2. The default log_level will be decreased from WARN (extremely spartan) to INFO (fairly verbose).
#      The -D option, which sets the log level to DEBUG, will be respected whether or not
#      YARALYZER_LOG_DIR is configured.
